## About Event App

Event App is a simple Event Management application designed to help you manage your events. An Event is an activity, such as a Party, Function, Conference or Community Meeting and Event App allows you to Create, Edit, Delete and View Events.
## Tech Stack

## Your Task

Your task is to perform a code review and complete some refactoring of the existing Event App code base, specifically the EventController, Event model and Routes. The EventController contains a number of methods that are used to perform CRUD operations on Events. The Event model contains the logic for validating Event data and the logic for saving Event data to the database.

In the codebase, you will find a number of TODO comments that indicate where you should make changes. You should also make any other changes you feel are necessary to improve the codebase.

In addition to the TODO comments, you are also required to add an additional field to the Event Model. This field should allow a user to add and edit notes about an Event. The field should be a text field and should be optional.

As part of your code review, you should also check to see if all CRUD functiality for Events is working correctly.

This task is primarily focused on backend code. However, if you feel that there are any frontend changes that you would like to make, you are welcome to do so. You will need to at least make the necessary frontend changes to accomodate the new notes field.

## Time / Effort

You should spend no more than **2 hours** on this task. We're not seeking a perfect solution but are more interested in seeing how you approach the task and what you come up with in the time you have.

## Instructions

1. Fork the repository to your own Github Account.
2. Create a new branch called `code-review`.
3. Refactor the code as per the instructions above and commit your changes to the `code-review` branch.
